## GIT homeworks - scenarios
### GIT Homework 1 - JSON, XML + Bonus:sparkles:
This homework was about using GIT commands, creating repos for JSON, XML and TXT.
I haven't worked with json and xml, so I needed some additional info about these document formats' structure, given some comments in the following repos.</br>
On the other hand, as I have been already worked with txt, I decided just to add my first autotest instead of following TXT scenario.</br>
**Below you can look through the task scenarios. Please follow the links to see all commands and scenario descriptions.**

18. Synchronize remote and local XML repository.
### [Bonus - git init test repo](https://github.com/ida-que/Git_init) :point_left:
Here you can find a small file with my first automation test using Python/Selenium/Chromedriver. This was my first attempt, so please don't judge me harshly :see_no_evil:
1. Create a local repository _First_Autotest_ in the directory where the autotest file is located.
2. Create a remote repository in GitHub.
3. Connect and synchronize these local and remote repositories.
### [GIT Homework 2 - branching, push, pull](https://github.com/ida-que/GIT_branching/tree/main) :point_left:
**Scenario:**
1. In your local repository, make branches for:
- Postman
- Jmeter
- CheckLists
- Bug Reports
- SQL
- Charles
- Mobile testing
2. Push all the branches to the remote repository.
3. In _Bug Reports_ branch, create a text document with the structure of the bug report.
4. Push the bug report structure to the remote repository.
5. Merge _Bug Reports_ branch into _main_.
6. Push _main_ to the remote repository.
7. In the _CheckLists_ branch, create a document with checklist structure.
8. Push this checklist structure to the remote repository.
9. In the remote repository, do a pull request of _CheckLists_ branch into _main_.
10. Synchronize remote and local main branches.
